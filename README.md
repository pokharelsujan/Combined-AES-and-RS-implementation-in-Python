International Conference on Technologies for Computer, Electrical, Electronics & Communication (ICT-CEEL 2023)

#How to use

GroupA.py contains all the algorithm related to AES algorithm including encryption and decryption.
RE.py and RD.py contains the reed solomon codes for encoding and decoding.
implementation.ipynb is  use to pass the data and perform encryption and then passed through reed solomon encoder to add noise and use decoder to remove the error  and finally used decryption algorithm to obtained the original result.
